# Dynamic-Programming
This repository contains important dynamic programming questions and solutions. 

The repository contains three underlying problems of Dynamic Programming and their variations as well.

It also contains the recursive code of the underlying problems which have been converted to Bottom up and Top Down Dp.

The main three classes and their subsequent problems which are covered here are:
(1)0/1 Knapsack
  (1.1)Subset Sum Problem
  (1.2)Count of Subset Sum Problem
  (1.3)Minimum Subset Sum Difference
  (1.4)Target Sum Problem
  (1.5)Count of number of subsets with given difference
(2)Unbounded Knapsack
  (2.1)Rod Cutting Problem
  (2.2)Coin Change Problem 1-Maximize the number of ways
  (2.3)Coin Change Problem 2-Minimize the number of coins
(3)Longest Common Subsequence(LCS)
  (3.1)Length of Longest Common Subsequence(LCS)
  (3.2)Length of Longest Common SUbstring
  (3.3)Print Longest Common Subsequence
  (3.4)Length of Shortest Common Supersequence
  (3.5)Minimum number of Insertion and Deletion to convert one string to another
  (3.6)Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence
  (3.7)Print Shortest Common Supersequence
  (3.8)Minimum no of Insertion in a String to make it a Palindrome
  (3.9)Sequence Pattern Matching
 (4)Matrix Chain Multiplication
    (4.1)Palindrome Partitioning
    (4.2)Boolean Parenthization
    (4.3)Scrambled String
    (4.4)Egg Dropping Problem
